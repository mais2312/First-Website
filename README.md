# First Website
 
This is the first website I have created on the MadLab Intro to Web Development Course

This mark down file will also serve as a place to practisemy markdown syntax

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

**this text is bold**
*this text is italic*
~~this is strikethrough text~~

>This text is a quote

To make text azppear as code we use `back ticks` and it will change the appearence of the contained words

```triple backticks creates a block of code```
